# Emoji Disambiguation
This project used a Jypter Notebook to automate tagging the senses of each emoji. The results are datasets for disambiguating the most popular emojis. 

## The problem
- Emojis do not have explicit dictionary meanings like words
- They are ambiguous and subjective as their meanings are inferenced from text
- They do not have word equivalence and take on their own unique meanings
- They are extreme homonyms

e.g. Emojipedia interpretation of 'Upside-Down Face' ðŸ™ƒ : Commonly used to convey irony, sarcasm, joking, or a sense of goofiness or silliness.
