# Emoji Disambiguation
This project used a Jypter Notebook to automate tagging the senses of each emoji. The results are datasets for disambiguating the most popular emojis. 

## The problem
- Emojis do not have explicit dictionary meanings like words
- They are ambiguous and subjective as their meanings are inferenced from text
- They do not have word equivalence and take on their own unique meanings
- They are extreme homonyms

e.g. Emojipedia interpretation of 'Upside-Down Face' ðŸ™ƒ : Commonly used to convey irony, sarcasm, joking, or a sense of goofiness or silliness.

## Emoji Embeddings

- Emoji embeddings are vector represenations of emoji meanings
- All current methods are not context dependent. Often key words describing the emoji are used to embed it
- This means the wrong meaning of the emoji is often assigned

## The algorithm 

1. Given a Tweet with an emoji compute a sentence embedding of only the text - Using InferSent
2. Take the emoji of the corresponding Tweet. Embed all of its different senses.
3. Find the closest cosine similarity between the text of the Tweet and the emoji sense embedding.
